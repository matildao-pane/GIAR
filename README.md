# Application installation

## Databases configuration

**Neo4j**: Install the database in your computer and connect as localhost replacing `username` and `password` with yours:
````java 
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("username", "password"));
````

**MongoDB**: Install the database in your computer and create the giar database with the users and the game collections as described in the [Design document](/docs/Design.md).
